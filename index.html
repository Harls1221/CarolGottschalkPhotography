        <div class="about">
        At my 10th birthday my mother gave me a digital camera, hung up a sheet
         and handed my friends and I a stack of her dresses. We spent hours
          playing dress-up and taking photos and from that day on I have had a
          deep love for photography. As I have grown into an adult it is a
           passion that has continued to grow. From childhood games to now
            capturing lifes most special moments to cherish forever. I believe
            photos are a view into our past, when we're old and gray and
             memories have began to fade, we hold dearly onto those moments we
             were able to freeze in time and cherish the emotions caught in a
              photo.
